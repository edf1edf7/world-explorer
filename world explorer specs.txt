1. Start the Server
With Python
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell, navigate to your project folder:

cd "C:\Users\difal\Development tests\world capitals"


Then run:

python -m http.server 8000


If you want to use Node.js, run:

npx http-server -p 8000



Restarting your local server is simple! Here’s how you do it:

If You Used Python
Go to the terminal window where your server is running.

Stop the server:
Click the terminal window.
Press Ctrl + C (hold the Control key and press C).
This will stop the server and return you to the command prompt.

Start the server again:
Run the command again:
Apply to script.js
You should see the “Serving HTTP on…” message again.

1. Look for the Confirmation Message
You should see something like:
Apply to script.js
This means your server is running!
2. Open Your Web Browser
Go to the address bar and type:
Apply to script.js
Press Enter.



If You Used Node.js (http-server)
Go to the terminal window where your server is running.
Stop the server:
Press Ctrl + C.
Start the server again:
Run:
Apply to script.js

Or, if you used npx:
Apply to script.js


When Would You Need Node.js?
If you use JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) that require a build process.
If you run backend code written in Node.js.
If you use npm packages or tools that require Node.
For a static site/app like yours, Python’s server is enough!
